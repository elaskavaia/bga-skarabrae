Introduction

Around five thousand years ago, a resilient group of farmers and hunters built a thriving community on the Orkney Islands of Northern Scotland. Rather than discarding their empty shells, broken tools, bones, and other waste, they used them to form large mounds of earth over hundreds of years. Later generations dug into these midden piles to create a series of rooms and tunnels to shelter from the harsh winds and cold winter months.

Aim of the Game
The aim of Skara Brae is to gather various Resources in order to feed, clothe, and shelter the growing number of Settlers. Players take turns drafting Village Cards and using their Workers to Furnish, Cook, Craft, Clean, and Trade. At the end of each Round, players need to provide for their Settlers and will likely create more Midden that needs to be cleaned up. After 4 Rounds, the player with the most Victory Points (VP) wins.

Gameplay Overview
Skara Brae is played over 4 Rounds. Each Round consists of each player taking 3 turns. On each turn, players must select an available Village Card and place their Workers. Once all players have taken their 3 turns, the Round ends. Players must then carry out the End of Round steps, which mostly involve feeding their Settlers and producing Midden. At the end of all 4 Rounds, players add up their Victory Points to determine the winner.

Player Area
Players manage Resources in the Storage Area of their Player Board, advance their Furnish and Trade Tracks, place Workers on Action Tiles, and place Cards below their Player Board.

Roofs, Stone Balls, Utensils, and Spindle Whorls are placed on the left.
Settlers are placed below their corresponding Environment on the right.

Managing Resources

Resources include 16 types of wooden tokens and Boar tokens.
Resources must be placed in the Storage Area of the Player Board, with each space containing only 1 Resource.
If there is no space, players must move their Slider 1 column to the right.
Midden cannot be spent or used as a Resource. It must be cleared using actions.
Players lose VP for excess Midden at the end of the game.

Start of Round

All players gain 1 Worker of their color from the reserve.
Deal out 3 sets of Village Cards faceup in the middle of the play area.

2-3 players: Each set contains 4 Village Cards.
4 players: Each set contains 5 Village Cards.

Place the Turn Order Tile with Turn Markers to the left of the first set.

Turn Order
Players take turns based on the Turn Order Tile. They can either pass or take their turn.

Pass: Move the Turn Marker to the top space of the Turn Order Tile.
Take a Turn: Move the Turn Marker to the right space of the Turn Order Tile and carry out the turn.

Craft (VP for turned-over Action Tiles).
Roof, Utensil, and Stone Ball Cards (VP shown on each card).
Food and Skaill Knives (1VP per item in Storage Area).
